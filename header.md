# Just download

Repository of links to download Linux applications the way the developer
recommends it.

The main reasons for this are:

- Minimise the number of bugs and problems encountered.
- Increase security by reducing the number of 3rd parties involved.

The rules are:

- If there is more than one recommended option, choose the highlighted one
  (developers will usually put, for example, a big button for Flatpak and small
  button for `deb` and `rpm`.
- If there is not any recommended option (e.g. multiple GitHub releases) choose
  the most universal one.
- Never use community-maintained packages
- If the first recommended option is only valid for one distro, it is only
  valid for one distro. This generally means the developer tests specifically
  for that distro.

Where the developer offers multiple recommended options, the main one is listed
here.
